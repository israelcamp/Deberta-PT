# Longformer-PT
Longformer is a transformer-based language model that is designed to handle long input sequences, such as those found in documents, articles, and scientific papers. It is a natural extension of the popular BERT model, which is widely used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, but is limited to input sequences of up to 512 tokens.

The Longformer architecture introduces several key innovations that allow it to handle much longer input sequences while maintaining high performance. These include a novel attention mechanism that is able to compute self-attention across long sequences in an efficient and scalable manner, as well as a set of specialized attention patterns that can capture long-range dependencies between tokens.

Longformer has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a range of text classification and question answering tasks, as well as on more challenging tasks such as document retrieval and summarization. It has also been widely adopted by researchers and practitioners in a variety of fields, including natural language processing, information retrieval, and computational biology.

Overall, Longformer is a powerful and flexible language model that represents a major advance in our ability to process long-form text data, and is likely to have a significant impact on a wide range of applications in the years to come.

# A basic example on how we can use LongFomer

````python
import torch
from transformers import LongformerTokenizer, LongformerForSequenceClassification

# Load the Longformer tokenizer
tokenizer = LongformerTokenizer.from_pretrained('allenai/longformer-base-4096')

# Define the model architecture
model = LongformerForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('allenai/longformer-base-4096', num_labels=2)

# Prepare the input data
text = "This is an example sentence to classify"
inputs = tokenizer(text, padding='max_length', truncation=True, max_length=512, return_tensors='pt')

# Make a prediction
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits = outputs.logits

# Print the predicted label
predicted_label = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1).item()
print(f"Predicted label: {predicted_label}")

````
First we loaded the Longformer tokenizer from the `allenai/longformer-base-4096` pre-trained model. We then define the Longformer model architecture for sequence classification, with two output labels. Next, we prepare the input data by tokenizing the text and converting it into PyTorch tensors, with padding and truncation as necessary to fit within the maximum sequence length of 512 tokens.

Finally, we pass the input tensors to the model to obtain a prediction, and print the predicted label. Note that the outputs.logits tensor will contain the model's raw output scores for each label, which can be further processed as needed (e.g. by applying a softmax function to obtain probabilities).
